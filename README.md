Thank you for visiting my profile.
I am Ashita, currently pursuing BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur. I am an aspiring Data Analyst and strive to improve my skills as much as I can and become a successful engineer.
I had Computer Science in my high school (Blue Bells Model School, Gurugram), which helped me in creating my base in Python language.
I am familiar with Python and currently working on C++ skills. 
I have done the following certification courses which helped me a lot from my Basic to Advanced Python skills:
 - **Machine Learning with Python course from Acmegrade (in collaboration with MOOD INDIGO IIT BOMBAY)**
 - **Python CS50 course from Harvard**
 - **Programming Foundations: Fundamentals from Linkedin Learning**

I am also pursuing a few other courses, which I will update when I finish. Till then I will work on improving my skills!
